CLI 2 GUI

## Roadmap
- for Linux command line and powershell generate command, based on GUI options
  - can be wizard style or section wise i.e required, optional, common.
  - give examples as shortcut, clicking prefills options with link to share
- first iteration use Linux cheatsheet.
- can try autocomplete options as u type
- split screen where top is GUI and below is terminal output.
- goal is, design should be easy with cool UI, not overwhelming to users.
- Main goal to generate the command on terminal based on GUI input
- It’s for newbies who are afraid or don’t like terminal.
- Future feature: UI for config files (internally fill all required options and spit out the file)
- search stackoverflow for most asked question and provide ui for that
- plugin / modular app, where each command/config can be installed later
- example webmin, puphpet, [nginx config](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tools/nginx), http://clihelper.com/
