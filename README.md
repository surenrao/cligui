CLI 2 GUI

## Roadmap
- for Linux command line and powershell generate command, based on GUI options
-- can be wizard style or section wise i.e required, optional, common.
-- give examples as shortcut, clicking prefills options with link to share
- first iteration use Linux cheatsheet.
- can try autocomplete options as u type
- split screen where top is GUI and below is terminal output.
- goal is should be easy with cool UI, not overwhelming.
